* terminal (REPL) 
    - REPL should not only connect you to an app, but the whole system
    - edn and clojrue should be applicable to any part of the system
    - you should be able to control everything, including containers
    - basically, the terminal in linux gives you access to OS
    - REPL should give you access to the system (system is essentially OS)
    

* ui
    - files + REPL = UI  !!!
    - every event (creating files, editing) and REPL events  in the system should be stored
    - can be replayed and queried
    - what user does what
    - and UI (actual) in nothing more than a graphical representaion of that
    - files and REPL.

* eos
